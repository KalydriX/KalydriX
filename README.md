Hi there !

I’ve been passionate about games and gaming communities for several years, and i’m very motivated to join teams as a Discord Moderator. To me, moderation isn’t just about « enforcing the rules » but above all about creating a healthy, welcoming, and dynamic environment where everyone feels comfortable to participate.

I’ve always enjoyed helping others and being of service, whether it’s answering newcomers questions, easing tensions when they arise, or organizing small events to keep a server lively. I know how to be patient, attentive, and diplomatic with the community, even in tense situations. I’m also strict about applying the rules fairly and ensuring justice for all members, without favoritism.

Alongside moderation, i’m learning to use Unity as i train in video game development, a field i’m passionate about and eager to explore even further in the future.

I’ve also already created several gaming logos for teams and projects, and i keep photos of my work as a portfolio if you’d like to see some examples.

My goal is to combine my passions for gaming, creativity, and community management, and to keep growing and learning in these areas.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat, ask questions, or offer me a role in your team !
